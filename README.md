# AI-Powered Content Recommendation System

This project implements a hybrid recommendation system using collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. It provides personalized content recommendations based on user interactions and content features.

## Features
- Hybrid recommendation model (collaborative + content-based)
- Real-time updates for user preferences and new content
- Data preprocessing for users and content
- Model training and evaluation
- Simulated real-time recommendation adjustments

## Technologies
Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn`
3. Run: `python recommendation_system.py`

## Future Improvements
- Implement more advanced neural network architectures
- Add support for handling cold start problems
- Integrate with a database for storing user and content data
- Develop a web interface for easy interaction with the recommendation system

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the recommendation system are welcome. Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.
